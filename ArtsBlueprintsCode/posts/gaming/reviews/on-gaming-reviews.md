title: Gaming Reviews as a Game Developer and a Gamer
description: A perspective on the current state of reviews on games
---
People are conflicted on reviews before launch not happening (see the entire Switch 2/Mario Kart World situation)
I reiterate what I said before: I don't see any issue with pre-launch reviews not existing, but that also means I'm not buying it until I have impressions
I do get why press would be disappointed in it, though, since that drives revenue to them, but the callouts over this is have been a lot of double standards

Like, it's so hype/FOMO-driven sometimes that it ignores the actual value or lack thereof that a game has
At the same time, there's the other side of the situation where hype/FOMO is taken advantage of and having reviews could control it

TBH I don't really care much for traditional games media reviews outside of a few outliers but I do get why people would want them (off-topic but not really, but I find a shame that critic reviews are so score-driven)

I'm more of a wary one because, even if a game studio has a good track record, there's always the chance the game is a miss or there's bugs, glitches, softlocks, weird oversights etc.
So I tend to wait for reviews before buying to see if it passes the sniff test of being a playable game
But I find distasteful that people tend to both say that reviewers are devalued by not having a game before launch and that reviews don't matter if they're not out before/at launch
I can understand thinking one or the other, but both at the same time (which is what a vocal minority is arguing) is kinda diminishing the value of reviewers 

There's also the whole matter of shadowdrops, early access, pre-orders and thousands and thousands of games launching year on year who do not get reviews before launch and aren't subject to this amount of outrage

Even more ironic that the devs being more transparent leads to more harassment and insane takes over this
> If you think it has nothing to do with FOMO then you clearly don't get what FOMO is. Imagine saying - **_"you can't expect people to "wait for reviews" for all games just because they want reviews"_** . Come again?!! Of course you can. That is literally what people who want to read reviews have to do - every - single - time - something gets reviewed. If Silksong reviews were at launch - they would wait until launch. If reviews come a week after launch - you wait until a week after launch. This isn't some revelation - the date is completely arbitrary. If you somehow cannot wait an extra few days - then yes that is what FOMO is.
> Imagine waiting 7 years and then refusing to wait an additional five days beyond the arbitrary date the devs choose to release the game.
