<ul>
<li>Swift programming of apps and frameworks for Apple platforms (iOS, macOS, watchOS, etc.)</li>
<li>Unity Game Development for PCs, Mobile and XR</li>
<li>Game Design, with a focus on systemic games</li>
</ul>
<p>As a Technician in Computing (2013-2017) @ IFCE, Bachelor in Digital Systems and Media (2017-2021) and Masters in Computer Science (2022-2024) @ Universidade Federal do Ceará, I focus on having a diverse background of skills, having also dabbled with: Electronics, Photography, Design, Audiovisual Works, Accessibility, Machine Learning, Data Visualization, Research, Presentations and many other areas…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>⭐️ You can view some of the highlights of my work over the years in <a href="Projects/">Projects</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently, I’ve been dedicated to my personal projects as an Indie Developer, but I am open to work opportunities, so anyone reading this that likes what you see from this website and wants to hire me for contract, contact me <a href="/Contact">here</a>.</p>
<h2>What can you expect from this site?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Posts talking about a variety topics from Design, Programming and Game Development and beyond</li>
<li>Showcase of projects I developed over the years and the process behind them</li>
<li>Devlogs about new projects I’m making</li>
<li>Some cool arts and crafts I made on my free time</li>
<li>Recommendations of cool content I find around the web as an Internet Explorer (get it?)</li>
<li>New things I’m doing and learning that could be useful to others</li>
<li>Updates about the Website and it’s features</li>
<li>Essays and Rumblings about subjects I’m interested in</li>
</ul>
<h2>🔭 What projects I’m doing?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improving this website with content and features ;)</li>
<li>Developing frameworks for Swift game development</li>
<li>Making a macOS app to link Notion, Obsidian, Logseq and Eagle together and use them in unison (maybe it’ll become it’s own Personal Knowledge Management)</li>
<li>Contributing to open source projects and designing some games in the background whenever time allows…</li>
</ul>
<h2>🌱 What I’m currently focused on learning?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Staying up-to-date with the latest Apple frameworks and technologies</li>
<li>Increasing my breadth of knowledge on Swift (Strict Concurrency, Interoperability)</li>
<li>General game development frameworks in Swift (RealityKit, SwiftGodot, Fireblade Engine)</li>
<li>Multiplatform Swift development</li>
<li>Deepening my knowledge of Godot and GDScript</li>
</ul>
<h2>🔮 What I’d love to learn/do once I get more time for?</h2>
<ul>
<li>visionOS and more Mixed Reality development</li>
<li>Swift on Server’s tech stack (Vapor, SwiftNIO, etc.)</li>
<li>Computer Graphics using the Slang language</li>
<li>3D Modelling and learning how USD and MaterialX work</li>
<li>C++ development</li>
<li>More Game Design projects</li>
</ul>
<h2>What else should I know about this site?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Updates may or may not be consistent, as they depend on the free time I have and work-life balance comes first for me. This also applies to which topics are covered and when they’re covered.</li>
<li>I tend to treat posts as full-blown pages that evolve over time instead of being one-and-done, so it’s worth coming back to read an old post.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/MartonioJunior/artsblueprintscode">source code</a> used to generate this website is Swift with a smidge of CSS for styling, but the goal long-term is for it to be 100% written in Swift :)
<ul>
<li>I plan to add new and interesting features to the website over time, but I’m currently not accepting feature requests and any pull requests will be closed.</li>
</ul>
